# Bare Bones

This OS is now finished: a slightly bigger version is being built at the [OS-MeatySkeleton](https://github.com/moddedTechnic/OS-MeatySkeleton) repository.

This is a very simple kernel build following the tutorial on the [OS Dev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones).

It has been created to learn the basics of OS development, and as such [notes](notes.md) have been taken on the process.
